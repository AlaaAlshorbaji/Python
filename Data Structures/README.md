# Data Structures in Python

This folder explores various data structures in Python. Data structures are fundamental for efficiently organizing and storing data, which is essential for AI and ML algorithms.

## Topics Covered:

- Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Hash Tables

Each data structure is explained with code examples in Jupyter notebooks. These examples cover common operations and use cases for each data structure.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks to learn about different data structures.
2. Run the code and practice implementing each data structure.
3. Modify the code to create more complex data structures based on your needs.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of Python programming is recommended.
