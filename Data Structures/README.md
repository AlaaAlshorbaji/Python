Built-in Data Structures in Python

This folder focuses on Python's built-in data structures, which are essential for efficiently organizing and manipulating data. Understanding these structures is key for Python programming and for building AI and ML algorithms.

Topics Covered:

Lists: Dynamic arrays that support indexing, slicing, and various methods for data manipulation.

Tuples: Immutable sequences used for storing fixed collections of items.

Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for efficient lookups, updates, and storage of related data.

Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements, ideal for eliminating duplicates and performing set operations.

Strings: Immutable sequences of characters used for text processing.


Each data structure is explained in detail with practical examples in Jupyter notebooks. These examples demonstrate the structure's methods, properties, and common use cases.

How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks for each data structure to explore its functionality.


2. Execute the code to understand how the structure works.


3. Experiment with the provided examples to deepen your understanding.



Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Python syntax and programming concepts is recommended.
