# Python Programming

This folder contains Python-related topics that are essential for understanding and working with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). It includes the basics of Python, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, libraries, and frameworks, as well as advanced Python concepts. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide to learning Python for AI and ML applications.

Each topic is explained in a separate Jupyter Notebook file. These notebooks include Python code examples that demonstrate key concepts, along with explanations to help you understand their application in real-world AI and ML projects.

## Folder Structure:

- **Python_Basics**: Basic Python concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and error handling. The folder contains Jupyter notebooks that explain these topics with hands-on code examples.
- **OOP**: Concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Jupyter notebooks will guide you through practical implementations of these concepts.
- **Data_Structures**: Key data structures used in Python, such as lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. Each data structure is explained with a notebook, including code samples and usage scenarios.
- **Libraries_and_Frameworks**: Common Python libraries and frameworks for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Notebooks will show you how to use these libraries for various AI/ML tasks.
- **File_Handling**: Working with files in Python, including reading, writing, and processing CSV and JSON files. Notebooks contain examples of how to manage data through file handling.
- **Algorithms**: Python code for implementing basic algorithms, such as sorting and searching. Each algorithm is explained and demonstrated in a separate Jupyter notebook.
- **Advanced_Python_Topics**: Advanced Python concepts, including decorators, generators, context managers, and multithreading. Each of these advanced topics is covered with clear code examples in Jupyter notebooks.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder based on the topic you're interested in.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the code explanations and learn from the examples.
3. Modify and experiment with the code to strengthen your understanding.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (you can use Google Colab or install it locally)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts is recommended.
