# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This folder contains the concepts and implementations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that is widely used in AI and ML applications for structuring code in a modular and reusable way.

## Topics Covered:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Special Methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)

Each concept is explained through Jupyter notebooks with Python code examples that demonstrate how to apply OOP principles in real-world projects.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore OOP concepts.
2. Experiment with the code to understand the practical application of each OOP concept.
3. Modify the code examples to create your own classes and objects.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of Python programming is recommended.
