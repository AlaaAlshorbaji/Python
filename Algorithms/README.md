# Algorithms in Python

This folder contains various algorithms implemented in Python. Algorithms are essential for solving problems efficiently and are widely used in AI and ML tasks.

## Topics Covered:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming

Each algorithm is explained with code examples and performance analysis.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks to learn about different algorithms.
2. Run the code and experiment with different inputs.
3. Modify the code to implement additional algorithms or improve performance.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of Python programming and algorithmic concepts is recommended.
